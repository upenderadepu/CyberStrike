# Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development (PO.5) Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Prepare the Organization (PO)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Ensure that all components of the environments for software development are strongly protected from internal and external threats to prevent compromises of the environments or the software being developed or maintained within them. Examples of environments for software development include development, build, test, and distribution environments.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development (PO.5) Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development (PO.5) implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development (PO.5) practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development (PO.5) Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development practice.

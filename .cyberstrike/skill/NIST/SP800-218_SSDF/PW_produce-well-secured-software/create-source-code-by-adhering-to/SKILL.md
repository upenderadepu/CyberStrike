# Create Source Code by Adhering to Secure Coding Practices (PW.5) Create Source Code by Adhering to Secure Coding Practices

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Decrease the number of security vulnerabilities in the software, and reduce costs by minimizing vulnerabilities introduced during source code creation that meet or exceed organization-defined vulnerability severity criteria.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Create Source Code by Adhering to Secure Coding Practices (PW.5) Create Source Code by Adhering to Secure Coding Practices is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for Create Source Code by Adhering to Secure Coding Practices (PW.5) implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of Create Source Code by Adhering to Secure Coding Practices (PW.5) practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows Create Source Code by Adhering to Secure Coding Practices (PW.5) Create Source Code by Adhering to Secure Coding Practices practice.

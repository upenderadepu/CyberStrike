# Review the Software Design to Verify Compliance with Security Requirements and Risk Information (PW.2) Review the Software Design to Verify Compliance with Security Requirements and Risk Information

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Produce Well-Secured Software (PW)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Help ensure that the software will meet the security requirements and satisfactorily address the identified risk information.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Review the Software Design to Verify Compliance with Security Requirements and Risk Information (PW.2) Review the Software Design to Verify Compliance with Security Requirements and Risk Information is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for Review the Software Design to Verify Compliance with Security Requirements and Risk Information (PW.2) implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of Review the Software Design to Verify Compliance with Security Requirements and Risk Information (PW.2) practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows Review the Software Design to Verify Compliance with Security Requirements and Risk Information (PW.2) Review the Software Design to Verify Compliance with Security Requirements and Risk Information practice.

# Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering (PS.1) Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering

## High-Level Description

**Practice Group:** Protect Software (PS)
**Framework:** NIST SP 800-218 SSDF v1.1

Help prevent unauthorized changes to code, both inadvertent and intentional, which could circumvent or negate the intended security characteristics of the software. For code that is not intended to be publicly accessible, this helps prevent theft of the software and may make it more difficult or time-consuming for attackers to find vulnerabilities in the software.

## What to Check

- [ ] Verify Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering (PS.1) Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering is integrated into SDLC
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline for Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering (PS.1) implementation
- [ ] Confirm automated tooling supports this practice

## How to Test

### Step 1: Review SDLC Documentation

Examine development lifecycle documentation for evidence of Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering (PS.1) practice implementation.

### Step 2: Verify Tooling

```
# Check CI/CD pipeline configuration
# Verify security tools are integrated

# Example: Check for SAST/DAST in pipeline
grep -r "security\|scan\|sast\|dast" .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null
grep -r "security\|scan" Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Assess Developer Awareness

Verify development team understands and follows Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering (PS.1) Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering practice.

## Tools

| Tool                | Purpose                            | Usage                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| github-security-mcp | Check repository security settings | `github_security_*` tools    |
| Manual Review       | SDLC process review                | Documentation and interviews |

## Remediation Guide

Implement Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering (PS.1) Protect All Forms of Code from Unauthorized Access and Tampering in the software development lifecycle:

Help prevent unauthorized changes to code, both inadvertent and intentional, which could circumvent or negate the intended security characteristics of the software. For code that is not intended to be publicly accessible, this helps prevent theft of the software and may make it more difficult or time-consuming for attackers to find vulnerabilities in the software.
